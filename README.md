# Project6
 Static Node.js and Express Site

 By: Maliha Taufiq

In this Project, I learned how to work with Node.js, npm, Express and Pug to render home, about and project pages. This project helped me to build a portfolio showcasing the projects I've worked on thus far. It includes a little about me, my LinkedIn page and live demos of my projects as well as links to the GitHub repositories.

 For extra credit, I setup my package.json file so that running npm start will run the app.
 I also used error handling middleware to render a Pug template.
 As for my CSS file, I changed the background color, color of the text and ____.


I am going for the "exceeds expectations" grade in this project. Thank you
